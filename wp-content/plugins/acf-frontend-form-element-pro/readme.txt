An ACF and Elementor extension that allows you to easily display ACF frontend forms for your users in the Elementor Editor so your users can edit content by themselves from the frontend.

== Description ==

An ACF and Elementor extension that allows you to easily display ACF frontend forms for your users in the Elementor Editor so your users can edit content by themselves from the frontend. 

This plugin needs to have both Elementor and Advanced Custom Fields installed and activated. You can create awesome forms in ACF which save custom meta data to pages, posts, users, and more. Then use this widget in Elementor to easily display the form for your users. This way you can pick and choose the data which you need them to be able to edit.  

So, what can this plugin do for you?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I send emails through this form? =

You can use a ACF "action hook" to send emails when this form is registered. See <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/using-acf_form-to-create-a-new-post/"> here </a> for reference.

If you purchase our pro version, you will be able to configure this from the widget without any code. You will be able to send any number of emails upon form submission. 

= Can I add Featured Image field to the form? =

Yes. Simply open the post tab and turn on "Featured Image". 

If you want more control over the label and field settings, simply add an image field in your ACF field group and set the field name to “_thumbnail_id” with an underscore before each word. 

= Can I let users set post categories through this form? =

Yes. Add a taxonomy field in your ACF field group and set "save terms" and "load terms" to yes. 


== Screenshots ==

1. This is the basic usage. The form displays the post's default ACF field groups. In our case, this post has no ACF field groups so it displays just the title by default. The form is visible by default only to administrators and will edit the current post/page. 
2. In this screenshot, we changed the form title to Business Information, we removed the title field and chose an ACF field group named "FrontEnd Form" to display. 
3. Here we configured the permissions. We left the default administrator role and we added a dynamic option that let's you choose a meta field that gives an id of any given user who should see this. In this case we used "[author]" which allows the author of the post to see it.
4. In the form actions, we left the main form action as "edit post" and we chose to edit a specific post. We left the rest of the option default, but we turned on the delete button so that our users have the option to delete the post if they so wish.
